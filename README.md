# Portfolio using bootstrap 
Bootstrap is a front-end framework that provides pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components, making it easier to create a cohesive design with responsive elements.

## Planning and set up
 Wireframing : using pen and paper or wireframe tools.

 Bootstrap integration : Include the bootstrap link to its CDN in the HTML to access components and styles. In this project, I have used Bootstrap 4 to implement Jumbotron feature

 ## Building blocks of bootstrap portfolio

 1. Grid system : Using bootstrap's grid system (container, rows, columns~) for layout structuring and responsiveness across decides.

 2. Navigation bar : Using bootstrap's NavBar component for easy navigation to different sections of portfolio.


 3. Cards and Thumbnails: Using bootstrap's card feature to display images, descriptions and links.

 4. Typography and styling : Using bootstrap's typography classes for consistent font colors, styling, spacing, alignment.

 5. Responsive images and medis : Using bootstrap classes to ensure images and media are responsive to different device screen size.

 6. Customizing bootstrap default styles with custom CSS styles.
